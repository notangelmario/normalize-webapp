# normalize-webapp

> A fork of the popular normalize.css, but with a few more tweaks to make the interface behave more like a native app

## Differences

This fork sports the same features as normalize.css, but with a few add ons such as:
- Disabling selection
- Disabling the blue highlight when tapping
- Disabling the right click
- Disable horizontal scrolling on body

## Usage

To install it simply run:

```
npm install --save normalize-webapp.css
```

This package was made with React in mind, it might work with other frameworks, but I didn't test.
